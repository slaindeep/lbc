            In a landmark ruling, the Delhi Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) has provided a significant boost for Indian investors in the UAE by clarifying that actual payment of tax in the UAE is not required to claim benefits under the India-UAE Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA). This ruling, stemming from Saket Kanoi vs. DCIT [2024] 168 Taxmann 418, underscores the importance of international tax treaties in fostering cross-border investments while ensuring fair and transparent taxation.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Case in Focus</h2>
          <p>
            The ITAT dealt with an Indian investor residing in the UAE who earned capital gains from the sale of mutual funds in India. The taxpayer invoked Article 13(5) of the DTAA, which grants exclusive taxation rights for such gains to the UAE. Indian tax authorities, however, denied the exemption, arguing that since the investor had not paid any tax in the UAE, he was not entitled to the treaty benefit.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>'Liable to Tax' Refers to Taxing Rights, Not Payment</strong> - The term 'liable to tax' signifies that the UAE has the right to tax the individual, irrespective of whether such tax is actually levied. This interpretation ensures that the absence of tax enforcement in the UAE does not disqualify treaty benefits.</li>
            <li><strong>India Must Honor Exclusive Taxation Rights</strong> - Under Article 13(5), the UAE retains exclusive rights to tax the capital gains in question, and India cannot impose tax on such income.</li>
            <li><strong>Treaty Obligations Take Precedence</strong> - The judgment reinforces India's commitment to upholding its international treaty obligations, ensuring consistent and equitable treatment for cross-border taxpayers.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Implications for Indian Investors in the UAE</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Tax Savings</strong> - Capital gains from Indian investments, including shares and mutual funds, are exempt from Indian taxation under Article 13(5). The UAE, which typically does not impose personal income or capital gains tax, becomes an ideal jurisdiction for maximizing after-tax returns.</li>
            <li><strong>Clarity and Confidence in Tax Planning</strong> - Indian investors can now plan cross-border investments with greater certainty, knowing that the absence of UAE tax payment does not affect their DTAA entitlements.</li>
            <li><strong>Simplified Compliance</strong> - The clarification reduces compliance burdens and litigation risks for investors by eliminating ambiguity around treaty application.</li>
            <li><strong>Investor Confidence</strong> - The decision aligns India's tax treaty interpretation with global norms, enhancing investor confidence and strengthening bilateral economic ties.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Strategic Insights from International Tax Law</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Non-Discrimination</strong> - The ruling ensures that treaty benefits are available to all UAE residents, even those who do not pay tax, fostering a fair taxation environment.</li>
            <li><strong>Treaty Supremacy</strong> - The ITAT upholds the primacy of treaty provisions, ensuring India remains a treaty-compliant jurisdiction, critical for cross-border investments.</li>
            <li><strong>Tax Neutrality</strong> - By preventing unnecessary taxation, the decision creates a tax-efficient environment for Indian investors to focus on wealth creation.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The ITAT's decision in Saket Kanoi vs. DCIT is a landmark judgment for cross-border taxpayers, reaffirming the robustness of the India-UAE DTAA. Indian investors in the UAE can now leverage this framework to maximize tax savings, streamline compliance, and expand their financial horizons with confidence.
          </p>
          <p>
            By honoring international treaty principles, India has not only provided much-needed clarity for cross-border taxation but also strengthened its position as a global hub for equitable and efficient tax practices.
